# TalanReader

## Introduction 

This is a project done for the Capstone Project, in the last month of the foundations program at Holberton School

## Problem

Need for a new feature when entering the data of new employees in the TalanSeeker application. TalanSeeker is a tool for managing and processing the company's talent data (both hired and in the interview process); to which it is proposed as an improvement to add a system for reading CVs (resumes) that complements all the data when entering new candidates and also being able to automatically generate standardized CVs to present the information available from each candidate.

## Proposal

It is proposed to create an interface that is easy to understand at the time of loading the data and that in turn allows easy integration into the TalanSeeker system.
An initial design will be carried out, to satisfy the basic scope proposed as MVP (minimum viable product) and detail its scope. The tool can be iterated in future stages together with TalanSeeker
increasing functionality or improving existing ones.

## Specifications

TalanSeeker is developed with (MEAN):

1. MongoDB
2. Express
3. Angular
4. NodeJS
5. Complemented with the Firebase SDK for user management.

The system will be developed with the same technologies proposed in the Stack of
TalanSeeker.

## MVP

1. Develop an easy to understand interface to upload CV files. (Pdf format)
2. Generate the corresponding Code to be able to extract the relevant information from the CV.
3. Automatic generation of a standardized CV format to present the information previously extracted.
4. Integration with the TalanSeeker application.
5. Assembly of the Testing and debugging of the Code to guarantee its accuracy and reliability.

6-  Complete documentation of the feature.
